            Hello! My name is Bryan, and I am from Lima, Peru. I finished my undergraduate studies in Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, and all of this time my research has focused on the taxonomy of <em>Frullania</em> and bryophyte floristics in Peru. Currently, my work focuses on resolving species complexes, evolutionary history, and distribution of this genus in the Neotropics. I am thinking to combine fieldwork, herbarium studies, and genomic approaches to delimit species, infer phylogenies, and study evolutionary patterns in the region. In my free time, I love to be outdoors, exploring nature areas, collecting plants and taking photos. Actually, I am starting taking photos of bryophytes to upload them in iNaturalist. If not in the field, I like to explore nightlife in cities, trying different types of beers and solving puzzles. Welcome to my page!
